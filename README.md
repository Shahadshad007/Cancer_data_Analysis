## Overview
The **Cancer Dataset Analysis** report provides a visual exploration of cancer-related data, helping researchers and analysts understand patterns, identify high-risk groups, and track progress in combating cancer.

### Key Objectives:
- Analyze cancer deaths by type and trends over the years.
- Segment data by age groups, regions, and continents.
- Provide actionable insights through interactive visualizations.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of three primary components:

1. **Type of Death (`Type_death` sheet)**:
   - Tracks cancer deaths by type (e.g., liver, breast, leukemia) for various regions and years.

2. **Continent Mapping (`Continent` sheet)**:
   - Links countries to their respective continents for geographic analysis.

3. **Age Group Distribution (`Age` sheet)**:
   - Provides data on cancer deaths segmented by age groups (`0-4`, `5-14`, `15-49`, `50-69`, `70+ years`).

### Features:
- Trends in cancer deaths by type across regions over time.
- Analysis of cancer-related deaths by age groups.
- Geographic segmentation based on continents.

## Features
- Interactive dashboards with filters for detailed analysis.
- Comprehensive visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.
- Custom themes for consistent design.

## Installation
1. Download the `.pbix` file and `Cancer_dataset.xlsx` from this repository.
2. Open the `.pbix` file using Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
3. Ensure the dataset (`Cancer_dataset.xlsx`) is placed in the same directory, or update the file path in Power BI.

## Usage
- Use slicers and filters to interact with the report.
